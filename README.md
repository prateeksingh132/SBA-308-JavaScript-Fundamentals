##### SBA 308: JavaScript Fundamentals #####

This is a project to grade leaner submissions using Javascript. The idea is to grade submissions by processing different data (course info, assignment group, learner submission) which are interconnected with each other.

# Technology Used:

Javascript

# Testing

I used the sample test data provided in the assignment for testing throughout my code creation. I also created few simple dataset, course info, assignment group, learner submission, just to test out that my code works for some edge cases like points_possible==0 and assignment's course id not matching the course id in course info and made sure that the result is formatted in the exact way requested in the assignment.

I have also created (and used during code creation) test points (log statement) at multiple places in the code, I have not removed them. They are commented at the time of submission and can be uncommented for future debugging and code check. These code checks looks something like:



////////////TESTING

//console.log('TESTING: assignment: ', assignment);

////////////



# Reflection

* What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?



* Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?


* What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?


* Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again:
